This page works by having by using a form with two fields for an input, which is for your name and your request.  There are also two buttons below.  The first button is used to submit the information and the second button is used to reset or clear the two fields above.  The name will be checked if it is empty and if there are any illegal characters used, otherwise a message will display that there was an invalid name.
